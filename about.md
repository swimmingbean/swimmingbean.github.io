Currently learning to make a blog and make an online home for the chicken scratches I've accumulated so far.

Status:
* Blog is now up
* Got a couple starter posts up too
* It's a bit ugly. Could use better styling, colors and formatting
* Markdown is unweildy, doesnt give me the formatting capabilities I want. I understand that Markdown is not intended to do the things I want to convery (Eg: two columns of text). I need to figure out what to use in conjunction with Markdown to do what I want and to make it easier to get the format I want.
