I read a couple of articles on blog landing page layouts and these discouraged having a list of posts as the landing page for the blog. I'm in two minds on the subject. I like some of the other landing page layouts because they're flashier and more stylish which appeals to the part of me that likes pretty things. I like having a list of posts on the landing page because that's the meat of the blog and I don't like to wade through a lot of pointless flash to get to the main content.

## Landing Page - Option 1: Jumbotron Image
<img align="right" height="150" width="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing-page-layouts/landing-page-idea1.png">This large banner should convey some sentiment that
expresses the my main message and have a single "call to action" button underneath. Something like "LEARN MORE" or "GET STARTED TODAY" or in the case of a blog this might just be a link to the posts. I don't like the experience of having to go to a second page to see the list of posts so if I went with this option, I would put the list of posts beneath the banner so the user just scroll down to get to the meat of the site.

## Landing Page - Option 2: Jumbotron with image + intro/bio
<img align="left" height="150" width="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing-page-layouts/landing-page-idea2.png"> This option is similar to the first option in that both open to a large banner with the list of posts starting underneath and continuing off-screen. If I had some important introductory verbiage like a biography or myself or an introduction to my blog contents or blog vision then I could have the jumbotron consist of an image on one side with the short paragraph on the other. The image could be an image of myself if I wanted to use have the blog also act as a personal webpage.

The list of posts layout options below can be used in conjunction with one of the above options. The list of posts can begin below the jumbotron and the list of posts can be one of these options. If I continue with having a plain list of posts as the blog landing page then the options below can be the landing page in its entirety or the list of posts could be separate page linked from the landing page.

## Posts List - Option 1: simple list
<img align="right" height="150" width="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing-page-layouts/landing-page-idea4.png">I like this option because it is very simple and I can fit more post titles on the screen. For dev and tech blog posts, I like being able to quickly skim through a list of all post titles and look for keywords on topics I'm interested in. If I have to click through multiple pages to see all post titles because each post title is presented on a bulky card, I'm unlikely to see any post titles beyond the first page or two.

## Posts List - Option 2: wide cards with title and Excerpt
<img align="left" height="100" width="150" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing-page-layouts/landing-page-idea3.png">I like this because presenting things on cards looks nice and there's a lot of different options on how to style the cards. This narrow horizontal card is also a nice compromise between having a simple list of post titles and a large cards for each post.

## Posts List - Option 3: wide cards with title and excerpt and mini-images
<img align="right" height="150" width="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing-page-layouts/landing-page-idea6.png">Images on the cards can be a nice source of color and prettiness. Since my blog content doesn't contain a lot of images, I can't assume that every post will contain an image that can also be used in the post list view. If I went with this format I would create a set of small doodles or other personal art and randomly use one as a button of color on each post card.

## Posts List - Option 4: square cards
<img align="left" height="150" width="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/landing-page-layouts/landing-page-idea5.png">This is a cute look too. I have some concerns about the practicality. These cards take up more space and will result in fewer post titles in view at any time. Like option 3 above, these square cards could also contain a personal art thumbnail image.
