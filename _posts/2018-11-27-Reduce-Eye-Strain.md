title: Reducing Eye strain
---

When I started my last job my eyes regularly started to feel tired, sore and itchy.
I'm not sure if it was something in the environment like poor monitor configuration, dry, air-conditioned air, improper positioning of my chair and monitor or if this eye strain is
an eventuality of working as a developer full time with a mild internet addiction after hours. Any hoo, I've now spent a while reading about eye strain and how to alleviate it.

1. 20-20-20. Take a break from staring at your monitor. Every 20 minutes spend at least 20 seconds looking at something at least 20 feet away. Staring at the same focal point uninterrupted holds your eye muscles in the same contracted state without a break. This causes eye muscles to tire and wear down. You may experience temporary blurry vision when you try to focus on something far away. You may your eyes may eventually get more myopic as they elongate permanently to compensate. In addition to staring at something far away you can also incorporate [eye exercises](https://www.hdfchealth.com/knowledge-center/health-and-living-guide/eye-exercises.aspx) and blinking into your monitor breaks. Blink frequency decreases by about 40% when using a monitor.

2. After a whole day of working at a computer, it takes at least an hour break for you to regain full 20-20 distance vision. Driving glass with a mild prescription can make your ride home safer, especially on dark and rainy night.s

3. Eat walnuts. Tears are composed of mucus, oils and water. The water component of tears evaporates quickly. However the oil component lingers for longer in film over your eyes. Ensuring you have enough omega3 fats in your diet will ensure your tear composition is oily enough to keep your eyes feeling moist instead of dry. I like to eat walnuts with dates
as a snack. The sweetness of the dates and the bitterness of walnuts make for a tasty combo.

4. Stimulate tear production and unclog any blocked tear ducts by applying a warm compress to your eyes. You can microwave a facecloth and place it over your eyes or purchase a heatable gel eye mask. You may notice some crud around your eyes after the compress. You can wipe this away with a wet cloth.

5. Adjust your monitor brightness. The brightness of the monitor should match the ambient lighting in the room. The monitor should be brighter in brighter rooms and dimmer when the room is darker.

6. Enable red-shift for your display. Blue light especially later in the day can negatively affect your sleep quality. There are many phone and desktop apps that will automatically shift the tint of your display to be more red in the evening and night. OSX has a built system display setting called Night Shift. I use an app called [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en_CA) on my android phone and [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) on my Ubuntu machine.

7. Check the positioning of your monitor. The height of the monitor, distance from your eyes, angle relative to your body and position relative to windows and room lights can all affect the amount of strain viewing the monitor places on your body.

8. Try "computer glasses". These have some combination of anti-glare coating, a mild red tint and/or a slight magnification. I've got these, but I admit it feels a bit strange and I frequently forget to put them on when working.
