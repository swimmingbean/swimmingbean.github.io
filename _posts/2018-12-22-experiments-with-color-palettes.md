title: Experiments With Web Color Palettes
categories: [ themakingof ]
---
I've noticed that given a web color palette that I like, it is non-trivial to take that palette and map it onto the elements in my page. I can’t always capture the same feeling of the palette in my page. Sometimes the proportions are wrong. I might apply the accent color to section headings but my content just doesn’t have enough section headings to produce a pleasant effect or my content has so many section headings the accent color looks garish.

I've used my homework assignments for my online frontend development courses to play around with some color palettes. I figure I can squeeze in some practice of design skills and kill two birds with one stone with these assignments. Doing this on throw-away homework assignments was quite liberating because I felt free to experiment with a wider range of palettes including colors I don't normally gravitate towards. I think I should repeat this exercise with this blog and experiment with all manner of random color palettes to this blog without the constraint of trying to match my vision for this blog or selecting only colors I like.

I took web color palettes from these two posts:
* [50 Website Color Schemes - canva](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/)
* [50 Website Color Schemes - visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/)

Here are a couple of my attempts at applying pre-defined color palettes supplied to my responsive web development course homework assignments. The web palette is shown on the left with my application of it on the right.
