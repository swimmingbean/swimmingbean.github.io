title: Creating the site logo
---

## The Concept
The github user name Swimming Bean was selected from a random word generator after
multiple other options were rejected as already in use. It always seemed a little
out of place as the name of a software development blog. Last night, I was thinking idly of what a
swimming bean logo would like ... something water themed perhaps? and the concept of a bean submarine popped to mind.
I was immediately sold on the idea of a weird, whimsical, possibly sentient machine as the site logo. This concept changed
the swimming bean name from something I wanted to discard to something meaningful.

For me, the periscope with the
eye ball in it is the most important part of the icon because it has connotations of exploration and curiosity.
Curiosity and exploration are the tie between swimming bean submarine and the blog topics. The propeller is my second
favorite element. It looks really dorky which sets the tone I want. Propulsion from dorkiness seems apt.

## The Process
Before spending too much time deciding the style, shape and colors of the logo, I experimented with some free images
to test placement, size and color options. For the final version, I decided to keep a placeholder sketch
I made with my finger in Gimp. There are hundreds polished submarine logos that already exist.
The lumpy bean shape and the wobbly lines were more distinctive than any polished versions I came up with.
