title: Mentoring High School Students
---

Since 2013, I've worked with the local school board to host grade 11 and 12 high-school students for 1-2 week long work experience placements. Students who are interested in software development careers spend a week or two coming to work instead of going to school. The intent is to see the what day-to-day life in the industry is like. Students get exposure to the many different roles and career paths possible in this industry and to get some hands on work experience. I try to organize a technical project plus assorted other activities to get wider exposure to life in the tech industry.

Consistently the activity most valued by all mentees has been getting a chance to talk to people in varied roles. I try to setup conversations with as many people as possible and try to get a diversity in the roles and levels of experience amongst the participants.  Speaking to people in different positions with different levels of experience has been very useful to see the variety in educational backgrounds, variety in the skills and interests and different options for how a career could progress over the next 3,5,10,20+ years. A lot of my mentees, even at the university level, don't have much exposure to roles other than developer or tester within the industry.

I've experimented with different formats from group round-table discussions to 15-30 minute 1:1 chats with various colleagues. In either format, I give my colleagues as well as the mentees the following conversation starter kit during these speed-mentorship sessions. I've gathered these questions from mentorship conversations with both high school and university students.
